## 🚀 Why cpbattles?

Traditional competitive programming emphasizes **individual practice**.  
`cpbattles` explores a **battle-oriented approach**, where participants compete
head-to-head on the same problems, encouraging engagement, focus, and learning
through competition.

This repository serves as an **experimental foundation** for evolving
competitive programming battle concepts.

---

## 🎯 Who is this for?

- Competitive programming students  
- College coding clubs and communities  
- Developers interested in CP platforms  
- Open-source contributors exploring EdTech ideas  

---

## 🧠 Project Philosophy

- Keep the core **simple and extensible**
- Encourage **experimentation over perfection**
- Welcome **student and first-time contributors**
- Prefer **clarity over complexity**

---

## 🔄 Conceptual Flow

```text
User A ──┐
         ├───▶ Problem ───▶ Solution ───▶ Evaluation
User B ──┘
                  │
                  ▼
             Battle Outcome
```

The goal is to make this flow **transparent, modular, and easy to extend**.
